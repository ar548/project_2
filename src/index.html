				The Apple II was a great hit during its debut at the San Francisco's West Coast Computer
				Faire in April 1977. In the following year Apple put it in to production for the consumers and 
				while the Apple II wasn't the cheapest personal computer on the market it, it had a very strong
				following and support from the hobbyists. With the great mind of Steve Wozniak, the amount of 
				chips required in the apple II was greatly reduced. This was done by using each chip for
				multiple purposes.  At the time this was completely new and thought of as pure genius.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the apple II first shipped during June of 1977 it had some tough competition with
				RadioShack's TRS-80, because it was far cheaper than the apple II. Although the one thing
				Apple had over its competitors wasn't, efficiency or price, but the idea of what a
				personal computer should be.

				Apple, having progressed so far in just one year from the apple I to the Apple II, gave others
				hope. It gave them a vision of how amazing these "micro" computers can become. With
				this start Apple grew, along with its products, and the Apple II became a series of
				innovation.
