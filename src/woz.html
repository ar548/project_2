			<h2>Steve Wozniak (the Woz)</h2>
			<p>
			The Wizard himself! It could be argued that he is the origin of the PC revolution. A side story of his
			brilliance was when Atari was looking to make a circuit board that used fewer chips thans their current model. 
			Wozniak, in collaboration with Steve Jobs created a board that had 50 less chips than
			it did from the start, not to mention it only took them <em><b>four</b></em> days. Jobs and Wozniak earned a
			profit of $5000 together, although Wozniak was told differently and Jobs absconded with most of the money.
			The Woz truly cared more about the engineering aspect than the money his tinkeringm made. That's how this humble
			genius spends his days.

			</div>
			<p>
			As the years went on Wozniak and Jobs had their relationship withering because of unforeseeable
			variables. During Wozniak's first marriage Apple was becoming ever more successful, while his wife was
			feeling increasingly distant and isolated. This led to their eventual divorce. Although a bit tragic, as an
			outcome Wozniak became a workaholic developing greater tools for the Apple II such as a floppy
			disc, a way for it to connect to a printer, and other such useful functions.
			</p>
			<p>
			After the recent death of Steve Jobs, a movie was made to capture the history of Apple. When Wozniak had the
			chance to view it, he believed that credit should be given where credit was due and that there were many others who
			played a part in the creation of Apple but didn't receive any credit. This humble man did not want fame either; 
			he just wanted the facts to be factual and not give credit to myths such as creating everything from Jobs' garage.
			</p>
			<p>
			Now the humble wizard resides teaching children about computers, and has since been married to his current wife
			Janet Hill.
