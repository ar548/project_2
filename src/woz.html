			<h2>Steve Wozniak</h2>
			<p>
			The Wizard himself, this man can arguably be the forefront of the PC revolution. A side story of his
			brilliance was when Atari was looking for a circuit board that required less chips Steve Jobs came to
			the aid of our great overlord Wozniak. As a finished product, the circuit board had 50 less chips than
			it did from the start, not to mention it only took them FOUR days. Netting both Jobs and Wozniak a
			profit of $5000. Although Woz was told differently on their earnings and Jobs took most of the money,
			He truly cared more about the engineering aspect rather than the money, and that's how this humble
			genius spends his days.

			</div>
			<p>
			As the years went on Wozniak and Jobs had their relationship withering because of unforeseeable
			variables. During Wozniak's first marriage apple was becoming ever so successful, while his wife was
			feeling distant and isolated, which led to their divorce. Although a bit tragic afterwards as an
			outcome, Wozniak became a workaholic and developed greater tools for the apple II such as a floppy
			disc, and a way for it to connect to a printer.
			</p>
			<p>
			After the recent death of Steve Jobs, a movie was made to capture the history of apple. When Wozniak had the
			chance to view it, he was arguing for the people that were there to help but didn't receive any credit. This
			humble man doesn't want fame either; he just wants the facts to be facts and stories such as creating
			everything from Jobs garage to remain a myth.
			</p>
			<p>
			Now the humble wizard resides teaching children about computers, and has since been married to his current wife
			Janet Hill.
